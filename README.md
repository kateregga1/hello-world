learning github basics

Hello there,

My name is Geoffrey, a GIS nerd who is also trying to learn how to code.
Right now I am going through github basics. Trying to undersand commits, and branches.

One thing to remember, a commit is a save and has to be made with a message to inform other contributors what changes you were trying to make.

Cheers!
